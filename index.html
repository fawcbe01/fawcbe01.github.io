<h2>Meet Me!</h2> 
  <h3><u>My Family</u></h3> 
I come from a relatively small family. I have one older and one younger sister. My older sister is married and has two children, Madison and Peyton. Madison just started Kindegarten which is really exciting! Peyton is only 3 but she brings her own joy to the family. My younger sister is starting college this year at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. I am really close to my family and love anytime I get to go home and be with them.

  <h3><u>My Life at Luther</u> </h3>
 Here at Luther, I am really busy! I am involved in lots of activities including the Mock Trial team, and being the President of LC Democrats. On top of that I am a first-year RA in Ylvisaker and a TA for Behavioral Statistics. I also tutor two little boys downtown and help coach the Decorah Middle School Mock Trial team!
